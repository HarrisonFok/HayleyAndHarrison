This is a website of my girlfriend and I. Because I couldn't be with her on her birthday in 2018, I created this website containing all our memories for her <3

Location: XAMPP/htdocs/any_folder_name_you_want

To see the website,

3. Type the following: localhost/your_foler_name/home.html
4. In localhost/phpmyadmin, create a new database called "HayleyBirthdayWebsiteDatabase"

Note: some stuff was done through the Udemy course taught by Colt Steele
