	<h2>Met the Beautiful Girl</h2>

	<p class="quote">I was helping out with CCF booth as I accepted the invite
	to be a committee.  It was the first day. Later, I saw Jacqueline from Logos. 
	I remembered her because she was always with a guy (who later left the church) 
	back then, and it's also because she was one of the few people I talked to 
	during my days at Logos.</p>

	<p>Beside Jacqueline was a girl called Hayley. I thought she was CBC, and
	because CCF desperately needs new people, I sort of lied to her that we speak
	in English. However, she told me she speaks Cantonese. She wrote down her info
	on the paper.</p>

	<p>When it was 4, I texted her that CCF would be hanging out afterwards. However,
	she didn't reply until 5. I don't know why I really wanted her to reply me. Later
	in student center, I found her and so I called her name.  She might have thought
	that I was into her at the first moment, but it was because only two people wrote
	their contact information on the paper. Haha.....</p>

	<h2>Fear</h2>

	<p class="quote">I was so afraid that she would be "stolen" by people at SCCC.
  	I prayed hard on Saturday (September 23, 2017).  I fasted for the first time in my
  	life on Sunday (September 24, 2017).  And I continued praying.</p>

  	<p>It turned out that only a few new people came to CCF.  I was very happy with the
  	CCF program (I was doing PowerPoint slides and Hayley was sitting at the front). During
  	dinner, we talked a lot (along with Eric, Christie, Harmony, Chloe etc.). 
  	After dinner, we went to bbt at Midland & Finch Coco.  After bbt, I drove Hayley home, and we talked a lot during the ride.  Turned out she was also really into Streams of Praise!! 
	When I got home, Hayley asked if I arrived home yet <3</p>
	
	<p>We rescheduled to meet on Tuesday to teach her LINA01.  I asked if she would need a ride back home afterwards.  She said her class ends at 6, but I would have a CSCC01 team meeting that day too.  So she told me to text her. I drove her home that day and that’s when it all began!!</p>

	<h2>Surprise</h2>

	<p class="quote">Before, when I told her that I switched to Zion Alliance Church, she said she wanted to switch too.  She said she could sleep at her aunt’s place (Elgin Mills and something) the night after, so that I could just pick her up</p>

	<p>CCF had an event that day - watch Kingsman 2. I was going to give Hayley a ride. When I was leaving,
	I don't know why I walked through the BV study space (I've never done that before). When I went out
	after talking with a friend, I saw Hayley and her mom XD apparently, she came to attend the wedding
	of Hayley's aunt. We watched Kingsman 2 with Hayley, Alex, Chris, Katherina, Brian, Brian’s mom and his sister at Morningside Cineplex· We kept on talking throughout the movie, and apparently she watched Naruto too LOL</p>

	<h2>Confirmation</h2>

	<p class="quote">I figured out that 舅父 and his family actually talked good about me in front of Hayley and her mom.</p>

	<p>I got a real confirmation from her that she sort of doesn’t mind me.        
	1. She kept on talking to me.
	2. She left her instrument in my van before walking in 東北餃子王, meaning that she expected me to drive her home.  This meant that she doesn’t mind being with me even after my “confession” to her.  This in turn means that she doesn’t mind me <3</p>

	<h2>Success!!!</h2>

	<p class="quote">At 12, I picked up Hayley and we had lunch together at Noodle Star (Midland & Finch).  Then, we went to watch American Made (by Tom Cruise) together.  She was willing to go to Eric’s dinner concert with me! At 11:40pm, I confessed to Hayley.  AND SHE SAID YES!!!!!!</p>

	<p>We were going to stargaze, but then it turned out that there weren’t any stars in the sky.  So we wandered around for a bit. She said she wanted to go to the washroom.  We tried IC but it was locked.  Then we went back to the van. At that moment, I was hesitating whether to confess to her at that time or not.  I prayed and gave control to God. Then, I drove her to Pan Am and I turned off the van.  However, she couldn’t get in from the outside.  At that moment, I didn’t know what to do. Right then, people came out from Pan Am which allowed her to go in. </p>

	<p>Quickly, I grabbed the box (my gift for her: a paper flower and fake gold) from my bag.  I prayed so hard. When I saw Hayley going out, I grabbed the box, went out of the van, and confessed!</p>

	<p>At the beginning, it felt weird.  But when I asked her if she can give me a chance, she nodded her head!!!!!!!  Then I hugged her <3. When I was driving her home, I told her everything, and she seemed to have cried a little lol. She didn’t expect it to come that fast. </p>

	<p>I told her how much I had been thinking about her and thinking for her. I also told her that idk why I was imagining myself singing worship songs with her by my side (and praising God together). She told me she had been waiting for 3 years, and that she turned down a few guys because it didn’t feel right.  She didn’t like her previous one. Then we went out and had a walk (holding hands) to take a picture
	At the end when she left, we held each others’ hand <3</p>

	<h2>First Official Date</h2>

	<p>My mom told me about Port Union Waterfront Park, so I asked Hayley if she wants to go there after church (Zion Alliance Church) the next day.  She said yes!!!</p>

	<h2>First kiss!!</h2>

	<p>Hayley went to Zion Alliance Church with me (I drove her). After service, we went out for lunch with a bunch of Zion people (in the Sunday school class).  We had a lot of fun and she enjoyed it too! After lunch, we went to Port Union Waterfront Park. Holding hands, I told her everything about the weeks after meeting her.  Then she told me her story from her POV too.  She actually knew about my accident from before.  I was already suspecting that she might have known (through CCF dinner).  Turned out that I was right!</p>

	<p>At the beach, we sat down and she leaned on me.  She worked on her assignment for a bit, then we took a lot of pictures. After, we went to Yang’s BBQ.  She liked it a lot too!  When we were leaving, I figured out that something went into my finger. I got a split...  So inside the van, we took it out together, and I kissed her face twice.</p>

	<p>Next, we went to bbt.  My heart was beating so fast looking at her beautiful face (with a beautiful personality and a beautiful heart towards God).  When I heard about what happened to her, my heart ached.  I really wanted to show her my love for her.</p>

	<p>When it got late, I drove her home, but she said she didn’t want to go home yet.  So, we were talking inside the van.  I have never felt so comfortable before.  When it was 11:45 ish, we went out and had our first kiss <3  We went for a second kiss too lol. Then at her door, the townhouse was so dark, meaning that everyone went to bed already.  So, we had our third kiss as a farewell kiss <3</p>

	<h2>More kisses</h2>

	<p>We went out to Chatime to do homework, and Brian suddenly asked me and Hayley to lead worship next Monday.  We were deciding where to go to practice, then we decided to go to my place</p>

	<p>We practiced three songs, and she even stayed for dinner.  My grandma prepared good food for tomorrow and told her to come too. In the van, she said she felt warmth when she was eating with my family.  Apparently, she hasn’t had that for a long time :( She said her parents don’t focus too much on emotions, which left her finding other people to share with.  It must’ve been tough for her :( </p>

	<p>So I wanted to bring her here as much as possible (depending on my availability)</p>

	<p>We kissed a lot throughout the day XD</p>

	<h2>Declare to the world!!</h2>

	<p>Eric gave us a chance to be an on-screen couple in his music video (https://www.facebook.com/ericfokca/videos/719238808265720/).</p>

	<p>Oscar asked us if we mind to kiss and Hayley said "Of course not" XD (he and Eric looked away lol)</p>

	<p>We thought we were going to get sick, but we didn’t</p>

	<h2>Betrayal</h2>

	<p>I bumped into Samuel Choi and he told me about the Coco deal.  He asked me to go with him (buy the big one while he’ll get the free one) but I said no...that's because I wanted to go with Hayley LOL.</p>

	<p>So we went to Midland & Finch Coco with Hayley to get the deal (buy one <bigger> get one free). She spilled the entire bbt after dinner, so she was very sad.  But she didn’t have to be. When I drove her home afterwards, we kissed for an hour LOL</p>
